[[Fedimint Q&A]]

Fedimint is a new way of custodying bitcoin that enables communities of Bitcoiners to form communal lightning network aware and privacy preserving wallets that are run by the community for the community. 

It is still in the early stages of development and on this documentation site we will explore how it is designed, some of the interesting use casers (along with their trade offs) and how to get started. 

You could think of Fedimint as a protocoll for scalable custody in bitcoin that interfaces with the lightning network.  

It takes advantage of very clever technology and the very human circles of trust that we all possess, to provide a solution to custody that is more convenient than holding Bitcoin on a 3rd party exchange and less expensive and complex than most self-custody solutions. 

Whilst there is a trade off in the custody of coins, it also provides a framework for backups, inheritance process which can be difficult to impleemnt correctly in self custody. 

It has the added bonuses of improving user privacy, scaling Bitcoin and the Lightning network, lowering on-chain usage fees and can provide a non-exchange Bitcoin custody solution that is equally viable for people in the western world as well as the rest of the world.
