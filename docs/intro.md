# Fedimint - Getting Started

Fedimint is an open source protocol to custody and transact bitcoin in a community context, built on a strong foundation of privacy.

It takes advantage of very clever technology and the very human circles of trust, to provide a solution to custody that is more convenient than holding Bitcoin on a 3rd party exchange and less expensive and complex than many self-custody solutions.
