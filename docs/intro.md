# Getting Started

Fedimint is an open source protocol to custody and transact bitcoin in a community context, built on a strong foundation of privacy.

It takes advantage of very clever technology and the very human circles of trust, to provide a solution to custody that is more convenient than holding Bitcoin on a 3rd party exchang,e and less expensive and complex than many self-custody solutions.

This is a quick tour through the protocol to help you understand how it works and to answer questions around the trade offs, FAQs and common terms you might hear, as well as a quick overview of the different use cases. 

The purpose of this documentation is to explain how Fedimint works, in a manner that is easily digestible by a non technical audience, inspired by the bitcoin.org wiki.
