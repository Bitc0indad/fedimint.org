Fedimint is an open source protocol to custody and transact bitcoin in a community context, built on a strong foundation of privacy.

If you are confident taking self-custody of your bitcoin and running your own nodes, we highly recommend you do so. We are building Fedimint as a superior alternative to 3rd party custody. Fedimint is a mechanism for Bitcoiners and trusted community members to onboard their local communities to Bitcoin in a more accountable and private way.

This is a quick tour through the protocol to help you understand how it works and to answer questions around the trade offs, technologies, and common terms you might hear. We close this tour with an overview of several use cases we believe Fedimint can help with.

The purpose of this documentation is to explain how Fedimint works, in a manner that is easily digestible by a non technical audience, inspired by the bitcoin.org wiki.
