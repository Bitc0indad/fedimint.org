# Joining a Federation

## Know your family / friends / federation


## How do I sign up?


## Is it possible for a user to connect to multiple federations at the same time?

Although not planned for the first version, this is no reason why a user can not be simultaneously connected to multiple federations.  The user would see the list of federations they are a member of and the summary balances of each.  The federations that they are a member of will have no way of knowing which other federations the user is a member of and how much is held by the user in each.  

This could act to give a user more options to decentralise their trust as well as potentially open up arbitrage opportunities with the use of “FeDeFi” (see “Is it possible to perform “DeFi” on Fedimints?”).

## Do I need to go through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process to join a federation?

No.  But it is highly recommended that you only join federations where some or all of the guardians are people that you have a strong pre-existing relationship with or trust in.  Rather than KYC this fedimint promotes KYF (Know your Friend or Know your Family).
