# Would Fedimint federations need to be regulated?

This will of course depend on the way a Fedimint is set up and the laws in the local jurisdiction. 

However, most jurisdictions that regulate Bitcoin financial activities have exemptions for financial related activities that are not done by way of business.  There are a number of reasons for this but one is that it is normal for individuals to perform financial activities on behalf of friends and family and to require these activities to be regulated would quickly overwhelm any regulatory body. 

Imagine if anyone holding money for their child in a piggy bank would have to become a regulated custodian, or if to accept money from your friend to buy something for them from the local convenience store you’d need to register as a payment institute!

The most commonly envisaged model for a fedimint community is one made of pre-existing trusted guardians and users and where the guardians are not providing the service to make a profit but to help ensure that their and their friends’ bitcoins are kept safely and privately.  Furthermore, no one guardian retains total control over a user’s funds.
  
The UK FCA has a [helpful flowchart](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf) showing their process for determining whether or not an organisation needs to be regulated. However, it should go without saying that if you are worried about this, you should definitely seek legal advice in your local jurisdiction.

The protocol is flexible enough to support human rights groups in high threat environments. 

:::note
It is up to the federation guardians to consider the legal and regulatory implications of the deployment considered.
