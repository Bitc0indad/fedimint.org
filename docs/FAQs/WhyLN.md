# Why eCash integrated with Lightning?

Why Federated Chaumian E-Cash Interoperable with Lightning as a Scaling Solution? 

Step 1: At billions of people, not everyone can self custody through owning their own UTXOs without blowing out the UTXO set
Step 2: people will therefore have to have shared custody of ind. UTXOs either on chain or through shared lightning channels 
Step 3: it would be better if the custodian were not a single entity (thus the federated)
Step 4: it would be better if the custodian was not able to track the payment history of individuals and specific coins (thus the chaumian)
Step 5: it would be better if the claims to the custodian Bitcoin were 1-1 with Bitcoin (thus the ecash tokens denominated in sats/msats)
Step 6: it would be better if they were natively interoperable with savings technology and payments rails, Bitcoin and lightning, so you wouldn't have to also speculate on the value of alts while holdning ecash tokens (thus why not monero or zcash, although you could build a module to extend support for them and I think elsirion said on Seth's show that he's not averse to doing that later down the roadmap)
