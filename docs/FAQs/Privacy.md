Can stablecoins be used on fedmints?

  

In theory, stablecoins on Fedimint would be possible.  Liquid Tether (L-BTC) or potentially (once mature) Lightning Lab’s Taro would be examples of systems that could be implemented.  If included, FeDeFi functionality such as P2P exchange could be used to enable the exchange between Bitcoin and stablecoins within the federation while intra exchange arbitrage over lightning could further enhance this capability.
