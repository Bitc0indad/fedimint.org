# The history of Fedimint

## Who invented Fedimint?

The idea behind Fedimint - taking the Chaumian mint protocol and implementing it as a federation - was first conceived and implemented by Eric Sirion (who goes by the alias "[elsirion](https://twitter.com/EricSirion)") in mid 2021.
  
Today, a team of contributors work on the protocol to develop it further, provide on the ground product feedback, and increase adoption.
