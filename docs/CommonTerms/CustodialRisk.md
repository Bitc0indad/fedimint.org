Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank. Fedimint allows you to be your friends bank. 

There is a saying in bitcoin 

> Not your keys, not your coins. 

The purpose of this saying is to remind users of the risks of 3rd party [custodial risk](../CommonTerms/CustodialRisk).

The risk that you could permanently lose your bitcoins if the exchange or company that holds them for you [goes bankrupt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-14/celsius-discloses-1-19-billion-deficit-in-bankruptcy-filing), [gets hacked](https://time.com/6146749/cryptocurrency-laundering-bitfinex-hack/) or [simply "loses" them](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47203706).

Back in 2013, the Bitcoin exchange space was dominated by [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox), the exchange colossus based out of Tokyo, Japan and headed up by one Mark Karpeles.

Many people held their bitcoin on Mt. Gox until one day, it all vanished.Â  Users could no longer gain access to their hard earned or purchased bitcoin with the bankruptcy process still ongoing to this date. 

Fedimint aims to address this issue by providing a simple solution that sits between self custody and 3rd party custody -  "2nd party" or "community" custody.
