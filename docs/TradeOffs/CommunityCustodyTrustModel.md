A common critique of the Fedimint protocol is the level of trust which is invested in the Federation guardians. 

This is a reasonable concern for some, especially for bitcoiners coming from a full self sovereign custody arrangement, in which they hold and secure back ups to their own keys. 

In Fedimint you make some trade offs to your custody arrangements in return for benefits that include: 

- Private payments
- Privacy preserving community custody
- Simplified back up and recovery operations
- Simple user experience and convenience

This may or may not be an adequate trade off. 

Here we want to present a simple trust model to help understand this trade off and so that you can make up your own mind on whether to trust a Fedimint and with how much bitcoin.
