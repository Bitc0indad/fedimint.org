Fedimint, allows users to backup data to the federation which will allow them to recover Fedimint eCash tokens in the event of a failure or lost phone. 

Depending on the particular implementation in a federation, this backup could represent a risk to the privacy of the user as the back up is restored, given the user is presenting themselves to the federation. 

This is largely mitigated through the acceptance of the existing trust model for Fedimint i.e. Know your Federation, however, we will be expanding on this risk in due time as the backup protocol is finalised.
