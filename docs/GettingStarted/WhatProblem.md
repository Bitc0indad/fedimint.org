How does Fedimint help with on chain and lightning network scaling?

Fedimint allows users to share UTXOs. It allows one lightning node to service many users.    
There is [some recent research](https://github.com/renepickhardt/mpp-splitter/issues/12#issuecomment-1143772489) on how to scale lightning that suggests the possibility of widespread use of fedimint federations could increase the efficiency of the lightning network while also increasing the potential fees an LSP can earn due to increased liquidity.
