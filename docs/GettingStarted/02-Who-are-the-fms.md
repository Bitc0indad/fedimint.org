# Who are the federations?

Fedimint is a protocol to "be your mums bank".

### Know your federation

The specifics around this trust model and trade offs will be explored in [Trade offs > Custody Trust Model](CommunityCustodyTrustModel.md), but key to this is that you are taking on custodial risk from the federation in order to get the benefits of convenient privacy and custody services (backups, inheritance recovery, lighting transactions). 

Important to consider in this trade off is that Fedimint has been designed to be used by pre-existing groups where members already have high levels of trust in each other which mitigates the custodial risk. 

For example I am less likely to steal from my mum, her friends and my brothers than a random stranger on the internet as there will be social consequences. 

This model would likely would include families, friends, small villages and community groups as examples of groups with strong second party relationships.

This is in contrast to the distant third party relationships offered by an exchange or the first party relationship afforded by self custody.  

This setup also has the added advantage of [often being exempt from most regulatory considerations](../FAQs/RegulatoryQuestions).

:::note
This doesn't preclude the notion of "commercial" Fedimints existing in the future. 

As Fedimint is an open protocol, there is nothing stopping these entities being formed, however, it is not the specific problem being addressed and this may change the regulatory discussion.
:::

As such Fedimint provides a powerful platform to decentralize banking and custody infrastructure to a local level. 

By way of example consider two countries:

* **Country A:** Has four banks and runs on a closed money system with no competition between banks. 
* **Country ₿:** Has 100k banks running on an open money system, that allows competition from anyone. 

Given the intense competition in country ₿ you might expect the banks to differentiate based on their close trusted relationship to the user and a focus on their best interests.
