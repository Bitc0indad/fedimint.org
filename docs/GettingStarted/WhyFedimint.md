# Why Fedimint

:::caution
This Guide is being actively worked on!
:::

Bitcoin is a powerful human rights technology that enables anybody in the world to **be their own bank**.

It provides an open financial network that asks for nothing more than users to follow some simple rules and provide a large random number in order to transact. 

The reality however is that this requires a level of technical understanding, learning and comfort that takes time to build. 

Whilst many bitcoiners have proven to be more than comfortable with this trade off a large percentage have not. 

The simple convenient solution has therefore been for new users to simply purchase and store bitcoin on centralized exchanges, sacrificing the properties of bitcoin (private open banking) in favor of convenience and ease of use. 

Fedimint is an open protocol for community custody that seeks to address the risks of centralization of bitcoin (see [Why Community Custody](../FAQs/WhyCommunityCustody)).

Put simply it allows you to **be your mum's bank**, so that she doesn't have to. 

Fedimint has also been design to interoperate with the bitcoin lightning network ([more here](../FAQs/WhyLN)). 

This allows Fedimint users to remain part of the wider lightning network merchants, making instant payments and moving between Fedimints without managing additional complexity.

This provides bitcoiners with a third option between 3rd party custody and self custody as shown in the figure below.

A user who previously may have used 3rd party custody for convenience can retain that convenience whilst improving their privacy and control of their finances. 

The specifics around this trust model and trade offs will be explored in [Trade offs > Custody Trust Model](../TradeOffs/CustodyTrustModel), but key to this is that you are taking on custodial risk from the federation in order to get the benefits of convenient privacy and custody services (backups, inheritance recovery, lighting transactions). 

Important to consider in this trade off is that Fedimint has been designed to be used by pre-existing groups where members already have high levels of trust in each other which mitigates the custodial risk. 

For example I am less likely to steal from my mum, her friends and my brothers than a random stranger on the internet as there will be social consequences. 

This model would likely would include families, friends, small villages and community groups as examples of groups with strong second party relationships.

This is in contrast to the distant third party relationships offered by an exchange or the first party relationship afforded by self custody.  

This setup also has the added advantage of [often being exempt from most regulatory considerations](../FAQs/RegulatoryQuestions).

:::note
This doesn't preclude the notion of "commercial" Fedimints existing in the future. 

As Fedimint is an open protocol, there is nothing stopping these entities being formed, however, it is not the specific problem being addressed and this may change the regulatory discussion.
:::

As such Fedimint provides a powerful platform to decentralize banking and custody infrastructure to a local level. 

By way of example consider two countries:

* **Country A:** Has four banks and runs on a closed money system with no competition between banks. 
* **Country ₿:** Has 100k banks running on an open money system, that allows competition from anyone. 

Given the intense competition in country ₿ you might expect the banks to differentiate based on their close trusted relationship to the user and a focus on their best interests.
